# React Three.js Website

## About this repo

This project is a modern website with a sleek and responsive design, built using React for the frontend. The website features 3D animations made possible by Three.js, a powerful cross-browser JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics. The backend of the website is built using ASP.NET Core 7.0 API, providing a reliable and scalable foundation for the website.

## Features
The website is built with the following features:
- A modern and responsive design using React.
- 3D animations made possible by Three.js.
- 2D animations using Lottie animation library, which relies on JSON format.
- A reliable and scalable backend built with ASP.NET Core 7.0 API.

## Getting Started with The Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To get started with the project, you will need to have Node.js and .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.

You can download them from the following links:
- https://nodejs.org/en
- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Once you have Node.js and .NET Core SDK installed, you can follow these steps:
- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
- Run "npm install" command to install the required dependencies for the frontend.
- Navigate to the api directory and run "dotnet run" command to start the API.
- Navigate back to the root directory and "run npm start" to start the frontend.

The website should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## About The Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
